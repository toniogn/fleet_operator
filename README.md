# Fleet Operator

## Introduction

Fleet operator is a demonstration project to illustrate and practice hexagonal architecture designing. The business logic purpose is to simulate usage scenarios on an EV vehicles fleet depending on a sorting criterion used to decide if a vehicle of the fleet must be used or charged at some point.

## About Hexagonal Architecture (H.A.)

![hexagonal architecture scheme](https://blog.octo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/archi_hexa_06-1024x526.png)

H.A. is a designing pattern which aims to uncouple the business logic (the hexagon) from the user and the server sides. Practically its realized thanks to interface design pattern which allows to reverse server side dependency and weaken both sides coupling defining generic methods and rules to get and parse user inputs and resources data. For more information see [hexagonal architecture by octo](https://blog.octo.com/architecture-hexagonale-trois-principes-et-un-exemple-dimplementation/).

## Practicing

The root folder contains two child folders. One containing a classical M.V.C. version (without explicit view) of the source code to refactor with an H.A. and the other to explore a refactored solution. There is multiple ways to do it, the proposed refactoring may not be the best one.

## Installation

- Start a terminal and switch to your local repositories folder
- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/toniogn/fleet_operator.git`.
- Create a dedicated virtual environment with `–m venv your_venv_name`.
- Activate it with `your_venv_name/Scripts/activate`.
- Install dependencies with `pip install –r requirements.txt`.

## Repository content

The repository is organized as follows :
```

-----> generate_fleet_json.py: generate resources data
-----> generate_inputs_json.py: generate inputs data
-----> main_to_refactor.py: main file to practice refactoring on
-----> main_refactored.py: main file for the refactored solution
-> src: contains source codes
-----> fleet_operator_refactored: contains an H.A. refactored solution
---------> data
-------------> inputs.json: inputs data generated in generate_scenario_json
-------------> fleet.json: resources data generated in generate_fleet_json
---------> utils
-------------> criterions.py: contains sorting functions to decide which vehicle to send for a given task

## Current functioning and problematics

The software version to refactor works as follows :
- FleetControler is instanciated.
  - A Fleet is instanciated and populated with the build_fleet method from fleet.json data.
- A simulation start with the controler's run method taking a sorting function from criterions.py as parameter and loading inputs data from input.json.

Their are two main problematics with M.V.C architecture:

- At « server-side »: dependency must be reversed. With M.V.C. pattern the business logic depends on resources, it has to load them according to the chosen infrastructure. To reverse it one has to create an interface detailing how resources must be loaded and at least one inheriting adapter dedicated to a given resources infrastructure loading.
- At « user-side »: dependency is already well oreiented. For instance, from a python console you can import, instanciate and use business logic objects. Nevertheless, H.A. gives the advantage to explicitly limit the visible method interacting with the business logic. So an interface at this side with at least one adapter should also be implemented.

## Instructions

The instructions could be listed as follows:
- Create inputs.py and resources.py modules respectively implementing Input and Resources interfaces with get_inputs and get_resources abstract methods both returning dictionaries.
- In each pre-created module, implement adapters JsonInput and JsonResources, inherited from interfaces, respectively loading data from inputs.json and fleet.json.

For interfaces implementing, use the abc library:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Interface(ABC):
  @abstractmethod
  def abstract_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
    pass
```
